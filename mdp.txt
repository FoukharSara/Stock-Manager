Man has only one right arm. Right arm belongs to one man.

Saying it inversely looks a little weird:

Right arm has a man. A man belongs to right arm.

You can have man without right arm. But alone right arm is useless.

In sequelize if RightArm and Man are models, it may looks like:

Man.hasOne(RightArm);      // ManId in RigthArm
RightArm.belongsTo(Man);   // ManId in RigthArm


and if we use has many we use belongs to
